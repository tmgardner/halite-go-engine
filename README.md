# halite-swig

A swig wrapper for Halite core game logic. Can be used simulate board states, generate test boards, and run in process games.

Currently only supports go & python, and a very limited interface, hoping to hack more in here.

# Generating swig

## Go

Install swig > 3.0, then run:

```shell
cd src/halite
swig -v -go -cgo -c++ -intgosize 64 -I../.. halite.i 
```

Then edit halite.go and add:

```
#cgo CXXFLAGS: --std=c++11
```

To the big block comment before `import "C"`. Can't find a better way at the moment.

Verify with tests:

```shell
go build -v && go test -v
```

## Py3


```shell
# build halite.py
swig -v -c++ -python -py3 -I.. halite.i 
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
# verify halite.py
python3 halite_test.py
```

# Current things

1. SWIG can't handle the callback interface well? `go vet` doesn't work; maybe remove callback anyway.
1. Plumb through timeout interface?
